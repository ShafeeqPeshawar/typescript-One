Differences Between Type Aliases and Interfaces

Type aliases and interfaces are very similar, and in many cases you can choose 
between them freely. Almost all features of an interface are available in type, 
the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an 
interface which is always extendable.



Interface Extending an interface

interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Bear extends Animal {
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;
        

Type Extending a type via intersections

type Animal = {
  name: string;
}

type Bear = Animal & { 
  honey: boolean;
}

const bear = getBear();
bear.name;
bear.honey;




Adding new fields to an existing interface
interface Window {
  title: string;
}

interface Window {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

const src = 'const a = "Hello World"';
window.ts.transpileModule(src, {});


A type cannot be changed after being created
type Window = {
  title: string;
}

type Window = {
  ts: TypeScriptAPI;
}

 // Error: Duplicate identifier 'Window'.
