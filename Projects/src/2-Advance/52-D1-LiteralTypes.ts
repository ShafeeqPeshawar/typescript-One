TypeScript Literal Types

TypeScript Literal Types allow us to specify exact values as types of variables 
or types of return types of a function other than primitive data types this language 
contains. Literal Types define types of exact values in contrast to primitive types 
such as `number` which allows us to use a range of possible values. 
Therefore, these Literal Types only accept specific predefined values. 
This feature makes a variable, parameter, properties have extremely precise values 
of the type.

let marks:100
// now marks type is 89 and we can only store 89 in the variable and nothing else


 marks = 99  //will not work only 100 is assignable
marks = 100


console.log(marks)
